Lifecycle hooks are a set of methods in Angular that are executed at specific moments during the lifecycle of a component. These methods provide a way to tap into the Angular component lifecycle and perform custom logic or operations at specific points in time.

There are eight lifecycle hooks in Angular:

ngOnChanges: This lifecycle hook is executed whenever the component's input properties change.
ngOnInit: This lifecycle hook is executed after the component's constructor method and is a good place to perform initial setup for the component.
ngDoCheck: This lifecycle hook is executed during every change detection cycle and is a good place to perform custom change detection.
ngAfterContentInit: This lifecycle hook is executed after the component's content has been initialized and is a good place to perform additional setup for the component's content.
ngAfterContentChecked: This lifecycle hook is executed after the component's content has been checked and is a good place to perform additional operations based on the component's content.
ngAfterViewInit: This lifecycle hook is executed after the component's view has been initialized and is a good place to perform additional setup for the component's view.
ngAfterViewChecked: This lifecycle hook is executed after the component's view has been checked and is a good place to perform additional operations based on the component's view.
ngOnDestroy: This lifecycle hook is executed just before the component is destroyed and is a good place to perform cleanup operations for the component.



JVM
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. However, Java is platform independent. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.
Pause

JRE
JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is also written as Java RTE. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.

The implementation of JVM is also actively released by other companies besides Sun Micro Systems.


JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.

JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:

Standard Edition Java Platform
Enterprise Edition Java Platform
Micro Edition Java Platform
The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. to complete the development of a Java Application.

Introduction:-


Hello, my name is Vinod, and I hail from Andhra Pradesh. I completed my Masters in Computer Applications from Oxford College of Engineering, Bangalore in 2022. Following my graduation, I joined Capgemini in April last year.

Initially, I underwent Java Full Stack with Angular training, where I acquired knowledge in various technologies such as Spring Boot, Java, and Angular. I must say, I have a strong grasp of these technologies.

Later on, I was tasked with learning Salesforce. I dedicated the last 4-5 months to Salesforce training and obtained certification as a Salesforce Developer. I am happy to share that I am a certified Salesforce developer now.

In addition to my training, I have also applied my skills by building applications in both Java stack and Salesforce. In the Java stack, I developed an application called Book Inventory Management. Recently, I completed the development of another application, a Hospital Management System.
